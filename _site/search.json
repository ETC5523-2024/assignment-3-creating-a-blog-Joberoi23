I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Commerce from Delhi University, where I developed a strong foundation in business principles and economics. My current focus is on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to solve complex business problems and drive data-informed decision-making.\nIn addition to my studies, I co-manage a YouTube channel with a friend, where we post vlogs exploring various places around Melbourne. It’s a creative outlet that allows me to showcase the vibrant culture and hidden gems of the city. Whether it’s through data or digital content, I enjoy connecting with others and sharing experiences."

    "text": "Any nation’s literacy rate is a key sign of its socio-economic development. The actual literacy rate in India is calculated by dividing the total number of literate people aged 7 or older by the total population aged 7 or older, then multiplying the result by 100. Literacy data is gathered every ten years through the census. This regulates the percentage of the population proficient in reading and writing. In this blog we are looking at the variations in literacy rates between the 2001 and 2011 census periods across Indian states and union territories for the analysis. The objective is to comprehend local advancements and pinpoint areas that would require additional educational policies."

The literacy rate in India is calculated by dividing the total number of literate people aged 7 or older by the total population aged 7 or older, then multiplying the result by 100. Literacy data is gathered every ten years through the census. This literacy rate informs about the percentage of the population proficient in reading and writing.\nIn this blog, we look at the differences in literacy rates between the 2001 and 2011 census periods across Indian states and union territories. The main goal is to check whether there have been any significant improvements in total literacy rates over the years and to examine the differences between rural and urban literacy rates. The analysis also aims to determine whether there is a notable gap between rural and urban literacy rates and whether the gap is narrow or wide."

This is because Ladakh, the 8th Union territory, was not formed until 2019, after being separated from the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, Ladakh is not represented in the census data used for this analysis.\nDetails of work"
