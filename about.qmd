I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Commerce from Delhi University, where I developed a strong foundation in business principles and economics. My current focus is on leveraging data analytics and machine learning to solve complex business problems and drive data-informed decision-making. 

In addition to my studies, I co-manage a YouTube channel with a friend, where we post vlogs exploring various places around Melbourne. It's a creative outlet that allows me to showcase the vibrant culture and hidden gems of the city. Whether it's through data or digital content, I enjoy connecting with others and sharing experiences.
